		<head>Biographical Note</head> 
		<p>Yvar-Emilian Mikhashoff was born Ronald MacKay in Troy near Albany,
		  New York in 1941. He began piano studies with Betty Weir and Stanley Hummel in
		  Albany. At the Eastman School of Music in 1959, he first took a major in
		  composition and cello, then changed to piano studies with Armand Basile. In the
		  1961 academic year, he studied piano at the Juilliard School in New York City.
		  He also had a career as a ballroom dancer from 1962-1965.</p> 
		<p>In 1964 Mikhashoff entered the University of Houston for studies in
		  piano with Albert Hirsh. He earned a B.M. in 1967 and continued with graduate
		  study in composition with Elmer Schoettle and obtained his M.M. in 1968. It was
		  during this period that MacKay adopted his grandfather's name, Mikhashoff.</p> 
		<p>Receiving a Fulbright scholarship in 1968, he studied the music of the
		  French Impressionists with Nadia Boulanger. After his return to the United
		  States, Mikhashoff entered the University of Texas at Austin as a doctoral
		  candidate in composition and studied with Hunter Johnson, Kent Kennan, Janet
		  McGaughey and Karl Korte. He earned a Doctor of Musical Arts degree with a
		  major in composition and a minor in literature in August 1973 and founded the
		  Cambiata Soloists ensemble. In the fall of 1973 Mikhashoff was appointed
		  Assistant Professor in the Music Department at the State University of New York
		  at Buffalo. Based in Buffalo until his death in 1993, Mikhashoff had an
		  international performing career which led him to promote new music and American
		  music around the world.</p> 
		<p>Mikhashoff had a genius for programming, a talent he utilized
		  extensively while organizing many festivals and broadcasts of new music
		  throughout the world, including his work at the Almeida Festival in London and
		  the Holland Festival. Mikhashoff co-founded the North American New Music
		  Festival in 1983 with Jan Williams and remained a co-director until his death.
		  He commissioned works from such notable composers as John Cage, Lukas Foss,
		  Otto Luening, Poul Ruders, James Sellars, Christian Wolff, and many others. One
		  of his most notable commissioning projects occurred in 1982 when he
		  commissioned or solicited new tangos for solo piano from an international array
		  of more than 80 composers. Mikhashoff also edited publications of music,
		  including works by Henry Cowell, Lejaren Hiller, Conlon Nancarrow, and Virgil
		  Thomson. He recorded on the New Albion, Mode, RCA Victor, CRI, and Spectrum
		  record labels. Yvar Mikhashoff's support of contemporary music continues today
		  through the 
		  <extref href="http://www.mikhashofftrust.org/index.html"
			actuate="onrequest" show="new" role="text/html">Yvar Mikhashoff Trust for New
			 Music</extref> which was created by his estate to support composers and
		  performers of new music. </p>

		<head>Scope and Content Note</head> 
		<p>The collection contains 155 
		  reel to reel tapes featuring performances either by Mikhashoff or of his music, 31 reels that do not
		  contain performances or works by Mikhashoff, and 19 reels containing tape parts to accompany performances. An additional 5 LP sound recordings and 9 compact discs are included in the collection. The collection has been dated based upon the content of the reels containing Mikhashoff performances and works.
</p>		  
		  <p>The contents represent a portrait of Mikhashoff's career, not only
		  as pianist and composer, but also as a concert programmer. He had great
		  enthusiasm for exploring different musical themes, including tangos, waltzes,
		  and various eras and styles. This collection contains many examples of
		  Mikhashoff's own spoken word descriptions of the music he was performing.</p> 
		<p>The container list descriptions are based on the original inventory,
		  which presumably relied upon external sources such as container labels, not
		  auditioning. Reformatting the tapes reveals many details that were previously
		  not known, such as spoken word introductions, changes in program contents, and
		  even blank tapes. The reformatted digital files are listed for tapes in Series
		  I and V to provide some indication of how the files may match the listed contents.

         <p>Photocopy of printed program inserted for concert titled An evening with Lukas Foss although the origin of the tape is not certain. It could contain the a performance of the piece, the entire concert, or the tape part needed for duo performance of the composition. Mikhashoff and Williams performed the piece twice in 1982 (Paris and Buffalo); for both performances they needed a tape part; a description of the piece can be found in Foss: A bio-bibliography (Perone, 1991). See W79 in this book for alternate possible performance dates. The composition is written for 2 pianists and 2 percussionists or, alternatively, for pianist, percussionist, and tape.</p>
