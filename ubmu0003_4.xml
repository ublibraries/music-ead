		<head>Biographical Note</head> 
		<p>Dr. J. Warren Perry was born in Richmond, Indiana in 1921. He earned
		  his B.A. at DePauw University in 1944, his Master's at Northwestern University
		  in 1952, and his Ph.D. at Northwestern in 1955. Dr. Perry has been on the
		  faculties at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern Medical
		  School, and the University of Chicago. He was also employed as deputy assistant
		  commissioner for research and training in the Vocational Rehabilitation
		  Administration at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in
		  Washington, D.C. Dr. Perry is the founder of the School of Health Related
		  Professions (now the School of Public Health and Health Professions) at the
		  University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. He served as dean of
		  the school from its founding in 1967 until 1977.</p> 
		<p>Dr. Perry devoted much of his life to supporting the arts. Before
		  moving to Buffalo he was one of the founders of the Lyric Opera Company in
		  Chicago. Since arriving in Buffalo Dr. Perry has served as chairman or board
		  member for several local organizations, including the Buffalo Philharmonic,
		  Community Music School, Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site,
		  Artpark, and Friends of the Center for the Arts. The numerous awards granted to
		  honor Dr. Perry's contributions to the community include the Buffalo Arts
		  Councils' Supporter of the Arts award, the Buffalo Distinguished Citizen Award,
		  and national Outstanding Philanthropist Award. Dr. Perry died August 5, 2010 in
		  Buffalo.</p>
		<p>J. Warren Perry was an avid collector of photographs and other
		  artifacts related to music, especially opera and ballet. He had the opportunity
		  to meet Maria Callas during his time at the Lyric Opera in Chicago. Through the
		  years he compiled a substantial collection of clippings documenting her
		  tumultuous career. Callas (1923-1977) was born in New York City to Greek
		  parents. At age 13 she moved to Greece where she received most of her musical
		  training. Callas's first performance in a leading role occurred in August 1942
		  when she sang the role of Tosca. Her stellar and influential career is well
		  documented through recordings, biographies, and contemporaneous accounts. </p>
