			<head>Biographical Note</head>
			<p>Yvar-Emilian Mikhashoff was born Ronald MacKay in Troy near Albany, New York in 1941.
				He began piano studies with Betty Weir and Stanley Hummel in Albany. At the Eastman
				School of Music in 1959, he first took a major in composition and cello, then
				changed to piano studies with Armand Basile. In the 1961 academic year, he studied
				piano at the Juilliard School in New York City. He also had a career as a ballroom
				dancer from 1962-1965.</p>
			<p>In 1964 Mikhashoff entered the University of Houston for studies in piano with Albert
				Hirsh. He earned a B.M. in 1967 and continued with graduate study in composition
				with Elmer Schoettle and obtained his M.M. in 1968. It was during this period that
				MacKay adopted his grandfather's name, Mikhashoff.</p>
			<p>Receiving a Fulbright scholarship in 1968, he studied the music of the French Impressionists
				with Nadia Boulanger. After his return to the United States, Mikhashoff entered the
				University of Texas at Austin as a doctoral candidate in composition and studied
				with Hunter Johnson, Kent Kennan, Janet McGaughey and Karl Korte. He earned a Doctor
				of Musical Arts degree with a major in composition and a minor in literature in
				August 1973 and founded the Cambiata Soloists ensemble. In the fall of 1973
				Mikhashoff was appointed Assistant Professor in the Music Department at the State
				University of New York at Buffalo. Based in Buffalo until his death in 1993,
				Mikhashoff had an international performing career which led him to promote new music
				and American music around the world.</p>
			<p>Mikhashoff had a genius for programming, a talent he utilized extensively while organizing many festivals and broadcasts of new music throughout the
				world, including his work at the Almedia Festival in London and the Holland Festival. Mikhashoff co-founded the North American New Music Festival in 
				1983 with Jan Williams and remained a co-director until his death. He commissioned works from such notable composers as John Cage, Lukas Foss, Otto Luening, Poul Ruders, James
				Sellars, Christian Wolff, and many others. One of his most notable commissioning projects occurred in 1982 when he commissioned or solicited 
				new tangos for solo piano from an international array of more than 80 composers. Mikhashoff also edited publications of music, including works by Henry Cowell,
				Lejaren Hiller, Conlon Nancarrow, and Virgil Thomson. He recorded on the New Albion,
				Mode, RCA Victor, CRI, and Spectrum record labels. Yvar Mikhashoff's support of
				contemporary music continues today through the <extref
					href="http://www.mikhashofftrust.org/index.html" actuate="onrequest" show="new"
					role="text/html">Yvar Mikhashoff Trust for New Music</extref> which was created
				by his estate to support composers and performers of new music. </p>

			<head>Scope and Content Note</head>
			<p>The collection contains approximately 1200 scores, chiefly for solo piano but also
				including other vocal and instrumental combinations. More than half the collection
				consists of photocopied scores, and there are more than 550 manuscripts and
				holographs (original and photocopy). </p>
			<p>The collection was initially processed and described by Matthew Sheehy in 1997. The
				current description is expanded both in terms of the level of detail provided, the
				range of dates represented in the collection (thus the disparity between the
				earliest date (1762) now stated in the collection versus the date of 1828 in the
				title of the collection), and also by the inclusion of additional works identified
				after the initial inventory was prepared. Also, some works in the series of unmarked
				scores are individually noted as having markings due to later examination. The major
				portion of the additions consists of works that Mikhashoff grouped together. They
				reflect some of his research interests and themes associated with concert programs
				he presented. These groupings include folders of material related to composers,
				including Lukas Foss's <title render="italic">Solo for piano</title>, composed for
				Mikhashoff, Charles Ives's Second piano sonata (<title render="italic">Concord
					sonata</title>), Sylvano Bussotti's <title render="italic"> Racine, pianobar
					pour Phèdre</title>, a collection of works by Percy Grainger, and Virgil
				Thomson's series of musical portraits. Thematic programs include the concerts titled
					<title render="italic">The Golden Clavier</title>, <title render="italic">
					Hollywood elegies</title>, <title render="italic">Miss Jane's parlor</title>,
					<title render="italic">Opera matinee</title>, and <title render="italic">From
					Vienna to New York</title>. There are also groupings for the works Mikhashoff
				collected for his Melodeclamation concerts and for the <title render="italic"
					>Buffalo Piano Collection</title> that he compiled.</p>
			<p>The range of repertoire, chiefly from the 19th and 20th centuries, is impressively
				broad. While Mikhashoff was best known for his performances of contemporary music,
				his research uncovered many works of the piano repertoire from many lesser-known
				composers, some of whom are now forgotten or rarely performed. The list of composers
				included in the collection is indicative of Mikhashoff's involvement in contemporary
				music in America and internationally. </p>
			<p>More than half of the scores contain annotations made by Mikhashoff in preparation
				for performance. The markings represent Mikhashoff's entire career: from markings on
				piano exercises such as Czerny's <title render="italic">School of velocity</title>,
				marked for Mikhashoff's piano lessons at age fourteen in 1955, through works
				composed for him during his last year of life. Many scores bear only incidental
				markings but there are also scores that are extensively marked. Mikhashoff sometimes
				re-notated works or passages from works, usually to make them more legible.
				Mikhashoff's versions of Foss's <title render="italic">Solo for piano</title> and
				Virgil Thomson's <title render="italic">Nineteen portraits for piano</title> were
				used for the published versions of those works. </p>

							<p> Instrumentation: For solo piano</p>
							<p>Markings on the photocopy are difficult to distinguish from markings
								on the original source.</p>
							<p>Photocopy of holograph, not Piano Sonata #2, Piano Sonata #3, or 3
								preludes. Incomplete. The first movement, marked "To John
								Kirkpatrick", appears to be complete on pages 1-6. The incomplete
								second movement consists of pages 7-8. There is a gap until pages
								17-18. It is unclear if this is the beginning of the third movement.
								There is a double bar at the end of page 18. Two unnumbered pages
								contain sketch materials.</p>

						<p>Sylvano Bussotti composed his Le Racine, pianobar pour Phèdre in 1980 and
							wrote the part of Monsieur Fred, the onstage pianist in the opera, for
							Mikhashoff. Folder 962 below contains the score that was used by
							Mikhashoff during the world-premiere and later performances. Mikhashoff
							later made a solo piano transcription of the work, although he did not
							completely write out every movement that he included in his
							transcription. It appears that he performed the other movements from the
							original score, condensing the piano and vocal parts as he played.
							Mikhashoff also worked with Bussotti on a different version of the opera
							reduced just for piano and singer.</p>

									There is now Pianobar pour Phaedra, a "micro opera" in three

									Pianobar is itself vaguely related to Bussotti's original.</p>
