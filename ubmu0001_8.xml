	 <head>Biographical Note</head> 
	 <p>Yvar-Emilian Mikhashoff was born Ronald MacKay in Troy near Albany,
	   New York in 1941. He began piano studies with Betty Weir and Stanley Hummel in
	   Albany. At the Eastman School of Music in 1959, he first took a major in
	   composition and cello, then changed to piano studies with Armand Basile. In the
	   1961 academic year, he studied piano at the Juilliard School in New York City.
	   He also had a career as a ballroom dancer from 1962-1965.</p> 
	 <p>In 1964 Mikhashoff entered the University of Houston for studies in
	   piano with Albert Hirsh. He earned a B.M. in 1967 and continued with graduate
	   study in composition with Elmer Schoettle and obtained his M.M. in 1968. It was
	   during this period that MacKay adopted his grandfather's name, Mikhashoff.</p> 
	 <p>Receiving a Fulbright scholarship in 1968, he studied the music of the
	   French Impressionists with Nadia Boulanger. After his return to the United
	   States, Mikhashoff entered the University of Texas at Austin as a doctoral
	   candidate in composition and studied with Hunter Johnson, Kent Kennan, Janet
	   McGaughey and Karl Korte. He earned a Doctor of Musical Arts degree with a
	   major in composition and a minor in literature in August 1973 and founded the
	   Cambiata Soloists ensemble. In the fall of 1973 Mikhashoff was appointed
	   Assistant Professor in the Music Department at the State University of New York
	   at Buffalo. Based in Buffalo until his death in 1993, Mikhashoff had an
	   international performing career which led him to promote new music and American
	   music around the world.</p> 
	 <p>Mikhashoff had a genius for programming, a talent he utilized
	   extensively while organizing many festivals and broadcasts of new music
	   throughout the world, including his work at the Almeida Festival in London and
	   the Holland Festival. Mikhashoff co-founded the North American New Music
	   Festival in 1983 with Jan Williams and remained a co-director until his death.
	   He commissioned works from such notable composers as John Cage, Lukas Foss,
	   Otto Luening, Poul Ruders, James Sellars, Christian Wolff, and many others. One
	   of his most notable commissioning projects occurred in 1982 when he
	   commissioned or solicited new tangos for solo piano from an international array
	   of more than 80 composers. Mikhashoff also edited publications of music,
	   including works by Henry Cowell, Lejaren Hiller, Conlon Nancarrow, and Virgil
	   Thomson. He recorded on the New Albion, Mode, RCA Victor, CRI, and Spectrum
	   record labels. Yvar Mikhashoff's support of contemporary music continues today
	   through the

	   at the North American New Music Festival (Buffalo, New York), tapes sent to
	   Mikhashoff by other performers or composers, and films by Lawrence Brose. The

		  <p>BBC TV: Vienna Now. Likely the following about the Almeida
		    Festival, from a BBC description: Vienna Now: Introductory Film Every summer,
		    the Almeida Theatre in Islington plays host to one of Europe's most adventurous
		    music festivals. This year its main theme is the music of Vienna today, and the
		    city's leading composers, Friedrich Cerha, Kurt Schwertsik and Heinz Karl
		    Gruber, are in residence at the theatre. Despite its reputation for
		    conservatism, Vienna was the crucible for many of the 20th century's most
		    radical developments in music and the arts. Michael Berkeley explores the
		    appealing and often ironic sounds of Vienna today with some of its most
		    important artistic figures. Executive producer Dennis Marks, Producer Peter
		    Maniura, Director Jane Walker</p> 
		  <p>Recorded at London (England).</p> 
		  <p>Performers: Yvar Mikhashoff, piano, and many others</p>

		  <p>Performers: John Cage, speaker</p> 
		  <p>Durations: 1:26:08</p> 
		  <p>At the beginning there seem to be 2 audio tracks: one clear, the
		    other via the room ambience which contains so much reverberation it is
		    extremely difficult to understand Cage's words. The clear track stops ca. 2:30.
		    Video very dark.</p>
